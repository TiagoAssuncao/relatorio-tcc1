     In recent years, social networks have had great visibility in the world of technology
     and are becoming a very important means of communication and information sharing.
     used by digital media users. The About Social Network (RSA) is an
     developed by a student of the University of Bras√≠lia that motivates users a lot
     but they do not keep them. Gambification, in turn, has techniques
     that motivate and engage users to perform a certain activity in each phase of
     use of the software, enabling them to be motivated in all of them. This job
     This is a technological development product, which will implement a
     Social Networking (RSA).

% In recent years, social networks have been highly visible in the world of technology and are becoming a means of communication and information sharing widely used by users of digital media, as indicated by (BOYD; ELLISON, 2010). The gamification, in turn, has techniques that motivate and engage users to perform a given activity, as advocated by (Deterding et al., 2011). This work is about a technological development product, which will apply a Framework for gamification in the Social Network About (RSA). After the application, a data collection will be performed to verify if the objectives proposed in the gamification were verified in the RSA.
