 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}


In recent years, social networks have been highly visible in the world of technology and are becoming a means of communication and information sharing widely used by users of digital media, as indicated by (BOYD; ELLISON, 2010). The gamification, in turn, has techniques that motivate and engage users to perform a given activity, as advocated by (Deterding et al., 2011). This work is about a technological development product, which will apply a Framework for gamification in the Social Network About (RSA). After the application, a data collection will be performed to verify if the objectives proposed in the gamification were verified in the RSA.
